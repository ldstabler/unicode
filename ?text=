<h1>Unicode Text Converter</h1>
<p>Convert plain text (letters, sometimes numbers, sometimes punctuation) to
obscure characters from Unicode. The output is fully cut-n-pastable text.</p>

<dt>What conversions does this do?</dt>
<dd><p>This toy only converts characters from the ASCII range. Characters are
only converted on a one-to-one basis; no <a href="combining.cgi?use=">combining
characters</a> (eg U+20DE COMBINING ENCLOSING SQUARE), many to one (eg
ligatures), or context varying (eg <a href="braille.cgi?text=">Braille</a>)
transformations are done.
</p>
<p>Current true transforms:<br>
<span class="alist">circled</span>, <span class="alist">negative circled</span>, <span class="alist">Asian fullwidth</span>, <span class="alist">math bold</span>, <span class="alist">math bold Fraktur</span>, <span class="alist">math bold italic</span>, <span class="alist">math bold script</span>, <span class="alist">math double-struck</span>, <span class="alist">math monospace</span>, <span class="alist">math sans</span>, <span class="alist">math sans-serif bold</span>, <span class="alist">math sans-serif bold italic</span>, <span class="alist">math sans-serif italic</span>, <span class="alist">parenthesized</span>, <span class="alist">regional indicator symbols</span>, <span class="alist">squared</span>, <span class="alist">negative squared</span>, and <span class="alist">tagging text (invisible for hidden metadata tagging)</span>.<br>
<br>
Psuedo transforms (made by picking and choosing from here and there in Unicode)
available:<br>
<span class="alist">acute accents</span>, <span class="alist">CJK based</span>, <span class="alist">curvy variant 1</span>, <span class="alist">curvy variant 2</span>, <span class="alist">curvy variant 3</span>, <span class="alist">faux Cyrillic</span>, <span class="alist">Mock Ethiopian</span>, <span class="alist">math Fraktur</span>, <span class="alist">rock dots</span>, <span class="alist">small caps</span>, <span class="alist">stroked</span>, <span class="alist">subscript (many missing, no caps)</span>, <span class="alist">superscript (some missing)</span>, <span class="alist">inverted</span>, and <span class="alist">reversed (an incomplete alphabet, better with CAPITALS)</span>.

Capitalization preserved where available.</p>

<dt>What makes an alphabet "psuedo"?</dt>
<dd><p>One or more of the letters transliterated has a different meaning or source than intended. In the non-bold version of Fraktur, for example, several letters are "black letter" but most are "mathematical fraktur". In the Faux Cyrillic and Faux Ethiopic, letters are selected merely based on superficial similarities, rather than phonetic or semantic similarities.</p></dd>

<dt>What is "CJK"?</dt>
<dd><p>CJK is a collective term for the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages, all of which use Chinese characters and derivatives in their writing systems.</p></dd>

<dt>What is "Fullwidth"?</dt>
<dd><p>These are "Roman" letters that are the same width as Japanese characters and are typically used when mixing English and Japanese.</p></dd>

<dt>What is the deal with "Tag"?</dt>
<dd><p>"Tags" is a Unicode block containing characters for invisibly tagging texts by language. The tag characters are deprecated in favor of markup. All printable ASCII have a tag version. Properly rendered, they have both no glyph and zero width. Note that sometimes zero width text cannot be easily copied.</p></dd>

<dt>What is the deal with "Regional Indicator"?</dt>
<dd><p>This block of characters is intended to indicate a global region, eg "France". As such some tools use short sequences of Regional Indicators to encode flags. The idea is that the same two-letter country codes used in domain names would be mapped into this block to represent that region, eg, with a flag. So U+1F1EB ("Symbol Letter F") and U+1F1F7 ("Symbol Letter R") are the way the French flag might be encoded: &#x1F1EB;&#x1F1F7; (results will vary with browser).
